#Part0: HIERARCHY
-----------------
    App
        SearchBox     
        CardList    
            Card 
            
#Part1: STATIC VERSION
----------------------
First I ll make a static version that renders my data model (will only have render methods).
I'll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props(parent to child). 

    CardList
    -I need to take external data ("cars" ) passed as prop from App
    -I ll loop in the "cars" prop and get each product which I will give to <Card> as prop
    -I ll put the cars in an array so I can display them in the render

    Card
    -will display the attributes of 1 car after receiving it as prop
    
    App
    -takes the cars array passed from the cars file and gives it to its child <CardList>
    
    index
    -made array of cars and passed it as props to <App>
      (It’s easy to see how the UI is updated and where to make changes since there’s only this source of data => React’s one-way data flow keeps everything modular and fast.)

#Part2: ADD STATE
-----------------
Second I ll add interactivity (*more thinking*) using STATE for the data that changes over time

1-let's make a minimal state. The projected pieces of data I have so far:
        
    P1: the original array of cars
    P2: the SearchBox input
    P3: the filtered list of cars
        
2-The power of yes. Now let's ask 3 questions for each piece of data:

    Q1- is it passed from a parent via props?                                   yes => not a state
    Q2- Does it remain unchanged over time?                                     yes => not a state
    Q3- Can I compute it based on any other state or props in my components?    yes => not a state
    
| P | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | STATE? |
|---|----|----|----|----|
| P1 | yes |  |  | no |
| P2 | no | no | no | *yes* |
| P3 | no | no | yes | no |      
 
3-Who owns this state?
 
    Q1-identify every component that renders something based on that state.
        A11: CardList
        A12: SearchBox
        
    Q2-Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy)
        App
        
    Q3-Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state
        None
        
    Q4-If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
        App     makes sense for P2 to live in
